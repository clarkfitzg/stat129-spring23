How are you?

1. Busy, heavy workloads / responsibilities
2. Graduating / work life imminently approaching!



Good:

1. Code / whiteboard
2. Actually useful
3. Class Discord great
4. Monday HW
5. Resubmissions "Kinda like how the class rewards your valiant effort."


Ideas:

1. Don't change anything.
1. Can't change the size of the live stream.
1. A manual on canvas with all the commands we use in class and with examples. +1
2. Videos linked on the Canvas as extra resources 
3. More quick simple exercises in class.
4. More challenging i.e. intro python was pretty easy.
1. Go slower.
1. CSC 20 requirement?
1. I think it would be nice if the quizzes were a bit longer
1. I think it'd be helpful if the professor can check with everyone at several points in the lecture to make sure everyone's on the same page. + 1
