How long did the whole program take to run?

Small thing- subtract out the mean for each station in the final plot so that we can compare all the changes together.

You went above and beyond the expectations by checking which stations existed in both years.

This is a sophisticated implementation, but didn't quite get to the final result.

This implementation that makes use of several different tools, good!

I'm impressed that you essentially did this whole assignment in awk. Not what I was expecting, but more power to you! 

You can simplify your code a bit by using `pd.read_csv(sys.stdin)`

Looks good!
Those "breaks" appear to be caused by missing data for some years in the middle, which is OK.
